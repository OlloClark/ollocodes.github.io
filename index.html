        About Me
      </h1>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Ollo Clark, a software engineer with a background in theater, education,
          and management consultancy. A fascination with language, logic,
          and puzzles allows me to tackle difficult or opaque problems with curiosity,
          energy and humor. Six years of stage work taught me real teamwork, while eight years of teaching
          taught me communication, connection, and patience.
        <br>
        <br>
          I recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Intensive.
          Below, you can find my projects, each built in no more than five days.
        <br>
        <br>  
          After that, I've listed a few examples of the front end components I've been building.
          Enjoy!
        </p>

            <h1>Project One: CATCH THEM</h1>
            <h4>A spooky spin on the traditional wordsearch</h4>
            <p>
              Something is asking for your help...or is it a demand?
              Assist as you will, but all might not be as it seems...
            </p>
            <p>
              CATCH THEM is the result of going from never having written a line of code to having coded for three
              weeks. I'm also confident it's the only
              wordsearch in the world with a secret alternative ending.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a big thriller/horror fan, and I like putting
              new twists on old classics. Help catch them, if you dare.

              We were asked to build a CRUD-fulfilling database as a project, and I didn't want to just submit
              something for the sake of it; I wanted to build something useful. I aim to make Furnish LA fully mobile,
              and my intention is to add geocentric photo functionality.

              Moving out of bootcamp, it was exciting to start trying to level my CSS abilities up to a
              professional standard. Creating this card was a great example of learning-as-you-go,
              and, as simple as it is, there was real satisfaction in creating something beautiful <i>and</i> accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
              I stuck very closely to the brief, but removed a suggested shopping trolley icon from the button, 
              as it cheapened the look. The button leads nowhere, but I look forward to attaching components like
              this to more complex projects in the future.

              This was a fun step up, in terms of integrating more JS and flexing 
              (as well as flex<i>boxing</i>) some more interactive CSS. 
              Overflow was not something I'd ever explored before, and is something I wish
              I'd understood before. No more box-y design for me.
            </p>
             <p>
              I completed the whole thing before a kind soul pointed me in the direction of the &lt;details&gt; element.
              While there was a small facepalm moment, I'm glad to have built a solution myself. Who wants to always
              take the easy, cheap route?
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              This one was a lot of fun, as it's a component that feels both fun to engage with and highly useful.
              Payment information pages can be rather dreary, so it was highly satisfying to build something that
              could keep a pleasurable UX design flowing right through the shopping process.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had to dive into some regex to make the credit card number appear properly, which was a 
              rabbithole I haven't explored before, but is definitely one I'm going to explore more in times to come.

              As I complete more front-end challenges, I'm learning that I take great satisfaction
              from the "aha" moment that comes from building all the little pieces I've intreracted with
              on the internet for years. This simple little component feels like another one to bank, and
              I'm intruiged to learn how it can be refined in the years to come. 
            </p>
            <p>In this case, I was actually happiest with going above and beyond. I wanted to explore
              turning the component into its own mini app, so I added in some code to allow the process
              to loop. It wasn't complicated, but it is satisfying to tie off loose ends.

          Burn rubber, not money.

          <br><br>
        
          For our group project, we were told to create a Django app, and in a time of volatile petrol prices,
          we decided to build something useful for the community. For the project, the information had to be user-submittable,
          which we recognize isn't the ideal form for a production app. We therefore sourced a paid-for gas price API,
          which we have waiting in the wings, should we ever take the project further. It is also optimized for mobile.

          <br><br>

          I am endebted to my fantastic team members- Elory He, Jennifer Dinh, and Mario Hernández Ortega- with whom
          it was an absolute delight to work. In the dividing up of our duties, I took up the mantle of scrum and GitHub
          manager, which was a whole new satisfying whirl of pull request etiquette!

          For our final project, we were asked to build a complete MERN stack app, implementing a 'likes'-type
          fucntionality. I chose to create a Kafkaesque, mock-governmental portal. The design is minimal, and the
          paranoia is overbearing.

          I had fun playing with user expectations on this one, and want to take it further, creating a gamified
          lesson on internet and data safety.
