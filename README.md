## Ollo Clark's coding portfolio

### Welcome! I'm Ollo. And I code.

I'm hoping to use my portfolio site as a whetstone for new front-end skills, as well as just a repository of past projects. If there's anything you like the look of, please do reach out!

### Technologies

Currently, this is an HTML/Vanilla CSS/JS project. I've considered frameworks like Tailwind, which I enjoy very much, but want to grind out the CSS myself for now as a learning experience. Maybe that willpower will change...

### Current goals moving forward:

* Adding a contact form.
* Developing the style towards "clean" and away from "flat".
* Convert from single scroll to a React app.
